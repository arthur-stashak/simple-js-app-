# Pokedex App Project description
This is an app I created that lists 150 different Pokemon, provides a picture of each, and additional information.

# How to the get the project running
I wasn't able to create a URL yet as the free version I normally use wasn't working. So I would recommend saving my code files to your computer and opening the index.html file from there.

# Project Dependencies
- Bootstrap5
- V8 javascript engine
- linter-js-standard

# API
The Pokemon list was provided by [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150)
